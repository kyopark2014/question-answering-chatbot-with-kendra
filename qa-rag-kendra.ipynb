       "\"Owner's Manual for Vehicle The Ultimate Driving Machine® THE BMW 3 SERIES SEDAN. OWNER'S MANUAL. Contents A-Z Online Edition for Part no. 01 40 2 960 440 - II/15  3 Series Owner's Manual for Vehicle Thank you for choosing a BMW. The more familiar you are with your vehicle, the better control you will have on the road. We therefore strongly suggest: Read this Owner's Manual before starting off in your new BMW. Also use the Integrated Owner's Manual in your vehicle. It con‐ tains important information on vehicle operation that will help you make full use of the technical features available in your BMW. The manual also contains information designed to en‐ hance operating reliability and road safety, and to contribute to maintaining the value of your BMW. Any updates made after the editorial deadline for the printed or Integrated Owner's Manual are found in the appendix of the printed Quick Reference for the vehicle. Supplementary information can be found in the additional bro‐ chures in the onboard literature. We wish you a safe and enjoyable ride. BMW AG   The Owner's Manual is available in many countries as an app. Additional information on the Internet: www.bmw.com/bmw_drivers_guide Online Edition for Part no. 01 40 2 960 440 - II/15 © 2015 Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft Munich, Germany Reprinting, including excerpts, only with the written consent of BMW AG, Munich. US English II/15, 03 15 490 Printed on environmentally friendly paper, bleached without chlorine, suitable for recycling. Online Edition for Part no. 01 40 2 960 440 - II/15 Addendum ADDENDUM TO OWNER'S MANUAL We wanted to provide you with some updates  and clarifications with respect to the printed  BMW Owner's Manual. These updates and  clarifications will supersede the materials con- tained in that document.  1.Where the terms “service center,” “the ser- vice center,” “your service center,” “service  specialist,” or “service” are used in the  Owner's Manual, we wanted to clarify that  the terms refer to a BMW dealer's service  center or another service center or repair  shop that employs trained personnel that  can perform maintenance and repair work  on your vehicle in accordance with BMW  specifications.  2.Where the text of the Owner's Manual con- tains an affirmative instruction to contact a  “service center” or “your service center,”  we wanted to clarify that BMW recom- mends that, if you are faced with one of the  situations addressed by that text, you con- tact or seek the assistance of a BMW  dealer's service center or another service  center or repair shop that employs trained  personnel that can perform maintenance  and repair work on your vehicle in accor- dance with BMW specifications.  While BMW of North America LLC, at no  cost to you, will pay for repairs required by  the limited warranties provided with respect  to your vehicle and for maintenance under  the Maintenance Program during the appli- cable warranty and maintenance coverage  periods, you are free to elect, both during  those periods and thereafter, to have main- tenance and repair work provided by other  service centers or repair shops. 3.Where the Owner's Manual makes refer- ence to parts and accessories having been  approved by BMW, those references are  intended to reflect that those parts and  accessories are recommended by BMW of  North America LLC. You may elect to use  other parts and accessories, but, if you do, we recommend that you make sure that any  such parts and/or accessories are appropri- ate for use on your vehicle. 4.At page 7, under the warranty section's dis- cussion of homologation, where it states  that you “cannot lodge warranty claims for  your vehicle there,” the text should read  that you “may not be able to lodge warranty  claims for your vehicle there.”  5.At page 7, under the “Parts and accesso- ries” section, in the sixth sentence, the  word “cannot” should read “does not.” 6.At page 54, in the “Check and replace  safety belts” section, the text beginning,  “This should only be done by your service  center …” should be disregarded and the  following text should be read in lieu thereof:  “BMW recommends having this work per- formed by a service center as it is important  that this safety feature functions properly.” 7.At page 91, under the heading: \\xa0 “Special  windshield,” the paragraph beginning,  “Therefore, have the special windshield …”  should be disregarded and the following  text should be read in lieu thereof: \\xa0 “BMW  recommends that you have the special  windshield replaced by the service center.” 8.At page 168 under the heading: “Objects  within the range of movement of the ped- als” and at page 232 under the heading:  “Carpets and floor mats,” the paragraph  that begins: “Only use floor mats …” should  be disregarded and the following language  should be read in lieu thereof: “The manu- facturer of your vehicle recommends that  you use floor mats that have been identified  by it as appropriate for use in your\""
